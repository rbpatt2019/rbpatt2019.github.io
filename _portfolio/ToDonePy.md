## Introduction

Move your ToDo's to ToDone's!

[ToDonePy](https://github.com/rbpatt2019/ToDonePy/) is a mature, command-line interface for managing your to do list. It provides a root command, `to`, and three subcommands:

- `to do` adds a new task to your list at different priorities.
- `to doing` shows you what you should be doing.
- `to done` removes a completed tast from your list.

It supports a number of additional features, including automatic task sorting and graphic notifications.
