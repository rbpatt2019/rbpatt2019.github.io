Ryan B Patterson is currently a Masters candidate who researches mitochondrial turnover in Parkinson's Disease at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. Because of his passion for data science, he is also developing his skills in Python and command line tools with a particular interest in the reproducibility and transparency of data analysis. He looks forward to a career using his neuroscience background to help guide solutions in data science and bioinformatics.

Ryan expects to complete his MSc by Research in Medical Science from The University of Oxford this fall. During these studies, he also took seveal courses in data science through the Fellowship for Advanced Education in the Sciences at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda. He also holds a BSc in Neuroscience and a BSc in Molecular/Cellular Biology with a minor in Spanish from Johns Hopkins University.

Outside of work, Ryan is an avid crafter with a penchant for crochet. He also enjoys cooking, dancing West Coast Swing, and hiking, and he hopes to take up tenor ukulele, if he can ever find the time!
