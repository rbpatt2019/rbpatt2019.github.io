Ryan B Patterson-Cross is currently a Senior Bioinformatician (Operations) at
Genomics England where he ensures smooth data flow through the analysis pipeline
by leading process improvement and troubleshooting the need of both internal and
external stakeholders.
As part of this role, he represents the team in ISO audits, manages a junior
team member, and leads development of new, cloud-native monitoring systems.
Previously, he worked at the Bio2Core, Wellcome-MRC Institute of Metabolic
Science, Cambridge, where he developed a
[command line interface for analysing lipidomics data][lta]
as well as several snakemake pipeline for sc-RNAseq analysis, including
a package to [query GTEx data in tissues][GTEx].
He moved to Cambridge after working as a research fellow in Ariel Levine's group
at the National Institutes of Health, USA. There, he developed a
[framework in R for quantitative selection of clustering hyperparameters][chooser]
and collaborated on a ML pipeline to identify cell types in a
[harmonised, sc-RNAseq atlas][atlas].

Ryan holds an MSc(Res) in Medical Science from the University of Oxford, where
he studied mitochondrial turnover in Parkinson's disease. During these studies,
he took several courses in data science through the FAES at the National
Institutes of Health in Bethesda. He also holds a BSc in Neuroscience and a BSc
in Molecular/Cellular Biology with a minor in Spanish from Johns Hopkins
University.

Outside of work, Ryan is an avid crafter with a penchant for crochet.
When he's not walking his dog or playing with his son, he enjoys Rubik's cubes,
playing octave mandolin, and constantly tinkers with his Vim/NeoVim settings.
