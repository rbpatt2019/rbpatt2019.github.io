He looks forward to a career using his neuroscience background to help guide solutions in data science and bioinformatics.

During these studies, he also took seveal courses in data science through the Fellowship for Advanced Education in the Sciences at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda. He also holds 2 BSc in Neuroscience and Molecular/Cellular Biology and a minor in Spanish from Johns Hopkins University.

Outside of work, Ryan is an avid crafter with a penchant for crochet. He also enjoys cooking, dancing West Coast Swing, and hiking, and he hopes to take up tenor ukulele, if he can ever find the time!
