Ryan B Patterson is currently a research fellow in the Spinal Circuits and Plasticity Unit, NINDS, NIH, where he applies his passion for transparent and reproducible data science to using R-based tools for the analysis of snRNAseq data. To help others develop best practices for their own projects, he also works as a teaching assistant for an Introdution to Python course at the Foundation for Advanced Education in the Sciences (FAES). He looks forward to a career using his neuroscience background to help guide solutions in data science and bioinformatics.

Ryan recently submitted his thesis for a MSc(Res) in Medical Science from the University of Oxford and expects to defend it this fall. During these studies, he took several courses in data science through the FAES at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda. He also holds a BSc in Neuroscience and a BSc in Molecular/Cellular Biology with a minor in Spanish from Johns Hopkins University.

Outside of work, Ryan is an avid crafter with a penchant for crochet. He enjoys cooking and hiking, and is developing a command-line task manager to make sure he has time for it all!
