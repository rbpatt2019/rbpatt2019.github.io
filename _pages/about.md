Ryan B Patterson-Cross is currently a research fellow in the Spinal Circuits and Plasticity Unit, NINDS, NIH, USA, where he applies his passion for transparent and reproducible data science to using R- and Python-based tools for the analysis of single cell RNAseq data. To help others develop best practices for their own projects, he also worked as a teaching assistant for an Introdution to Python course at the Foundation for Advanced Education in the Sciences (FAES). He looks forward to a career using his neuroscience background to help guide solutions in data science and bioinformatics.

Ryan was recently awarded an MSc(Res) in Medical Science from the University of Oxford after defending his thesis on mitochondrial turnover in Parkindson's disease. During these studies, he took several courses in data science through the FAES at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda. He also holds a BSc in Neuroscience and a BSc in Molecular/Cellular Biology with a minor in Spanish from Johns Hopkins University.

Outside of work, Ryan is an avid crafter with a penchant for crochet. He enjoys cooking and playing ukulele, and is developing a Dash app to help stay up-to-date with the most recent data!
