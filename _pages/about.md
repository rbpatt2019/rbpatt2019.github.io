Ryan B Patterson-Cross is currently a computational Biologist in the Bio2 Core, Wellcome-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, University of Cambridge, where he uses his passion for transparent and reproducible data science to provide scientific computing support to a broad range of scientists. He moved to Camridge after working as a research fellow in Ariel Levine's group at the National Institutes of Health, USA. There, he developed a framework in R for quantitative selection of clustering hyperparameters and collaborated on a ML pipeline to identify cell types in a harmonised, sc-RNAseq atlas.

Ryan holds an MSc(Res) in Medical Science from the University of Oxford, where he studied mitochondrial turnover in Parkindson's disease. During these studies, he took several courses in data science through the FAES at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda. He also holds a BSc in Neuroscience and a BSc in Molecular/Cellular Biology with a minor in Spanish from Johns Hopkins University.

Outside of work, Ryan is an avid crafter with a penchant for cross stitch. He enjoys cooking and playing ukulele, tinkers in Vim, and develops projects ranging from Dash interfaces to Snakemake pipelines!
