## Abstract

Generating single-cell data has become a common tool to examine tissue heterogeneity, and numerous algorithms exist for clustering these datasets. However, these algorithms rely on user-defined parameter values, often tailored to each dataset, to identify a set of biologically relevant clusters. Here, we illustrate a subsampling-based approach (chooseR) that simultaneously guides parameter selection and characterizes cluster robustness, consistently identifying optimal clustering parameters for different algorithms on multiple datasets.
