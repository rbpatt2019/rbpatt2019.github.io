## ABSTRACT

Multiple single cell atlases have been described for the mouse spinal cord, but this collection of
disparate studies has failed to lay a solid foundation for spinal cord biology in the
transcriptomic era. We created a harmonized atlas that unifies these studies into a common
framework. We found a hierarchical structure of cell type relationships amongst postnatal
spinal cord neurons, with spatial location providing the highest level of organization, followed
by neurotransmitter status, “family”, and finally, dozens of refined populations. We validated a
combinatorial panel of in situ probes for known and novel marker genes and defined the
location of each cell type in adult tissue. We incorporated embryonic data to reveal putative
developmental lineages for each cell type. Finally, we developed a website to share these
resources widely. This work provides an unprecedented view of spinal cell types, their specific
gene expression signatures, and the general molecular organization.
