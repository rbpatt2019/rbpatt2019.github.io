title: "Vision loss shifts the balance of feedforward and intracortical circuits in opposite directions in mouse primary auditory and visual cortices"

permalink: /publication/2015_06_01_vision_loss_shifts_balance
excerpt: 'Our results suggest that loss of vision produces distinct circuit changes in the spared and deprived sensory cortices to shift between feedforward and intracortical processing to allow adaptation.'
