The FAES [Scientists Teaching Science](https://www.training.nih.gov/sts_main_page) introduces scientists to the principles needed to teach and communicate their science effectively. Through this course, I gained experience with Bloom's Taxonomy, active learning principles, and inquiry-based science, all of which helped me strengthen my teaching and communication skills.
